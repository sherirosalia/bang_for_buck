## Stocks or Real Estate?
Which provides the biggest "bang for your buck", property or stocks? Does the advantage of compounded gains on the purchase price of real estate compensate for the historically higher rate of return in the stock market? This project provides 
a user controlled interface to assist evaluation of investing in various vehicles over time.

## Programming languages and frameworks
- Initial calculations were done with Python and these were converted to Javascript.
- The slider interface was built with jQuery UI. 
- Flexbox CSS

## Files
- "docs" folder holds website files
- "python" folder contains original python scripts containing foundation for calculations
- JavaScript is divided amongst three files: "magic.js" controls the sliders, "button_functions.js" contains calculations and "header.js" makes the header sticky.
