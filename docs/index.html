        <h2>Real Estate Market</h2>
        <p>Some of the considerations related to property investment in addition to appreciation 
            are repair, maintenance, taxes, insurance, vacancy rates and selling costs such as realtor 
            commissions. Additionally, real estate values are location dependent with rural or low income 
            areas generally less likely to accelerate in value than their counterparts but also may be less expensive 
            to maintain. 
        </p>
        <p>Other things to consider when evaluating real estate investment is the time consuming nature 
            of ownership and possible tax advantages. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Selling costs of 6% are automatically calculated for the user. This is based on 
            a broker commission of 5%. The remaining 1% is for title costs, buyer negotiated 
            credits and attorney fees.

            <h2>Real Estate Calculation Parameters</h2>
            <p>
              The buttons produce results that rely, with some variation on the following for real estate: Invested amount is considered 
              as a 20% deposit on a house and therefore the home value is 5 times this figure. 
              Also, we assumed a monthly rental income that covers
              mortgage, insurance and taxes. Additionally, we factored a vacancy rate of 4% and appreciation of 3.5%. There is some variation in 
              the "Strong Real Estate" calculation which assumes a handy landlord and a bit of good luck. To see specifics, reference the slider output below the chart. 
            </p>
            <h2>Stock Calculation</h2>
            <p>
                Stock appreciation is compounded just as the real estate values are, however the initial investment amount 
                is automatically deducted, so what is reflected in the stock investment output is the net difference between 
                final portfolio value less the initial amount. 
            </p>
            <h2>Caveats</h2>
              <p>
              Some <strong>caveats</strong> to bear in mind are that real estate mortgages are amortized. This is not reflected in the 
              results, so at the end of 30 years, one could argue that $200,000 (the mortgage amount) should be added to the final calculation because 
              the mortgage would be paid off, however a counter argument might be that to keep things equal, more money should 
              be added to the stock market investment too. This is something <a href="#footer_link_to">we</a> chose to keep out of our calculations and 
              therefore up it is up to the reader to adjust.
